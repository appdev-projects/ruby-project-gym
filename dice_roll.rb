# Write a program that:
#
#   - Ask the user for a guess at what number 
#     the die will land on and then generate a 
#     random dice roll (a number between 1 and 6).
#
#   - If the User guessed right, your program 
#     should print: "You guessed correctly"
#
#   - If they didnâ€™t, your program should print: 
#     "Shame on you. The die landed on x"
#
# Hint: Use the rand method for the dice roll.

p "Enter a guess:"


# ~~~~~ Specs (make it do these things) ~~~~~
#
# dice_roll.rb prints 'You guessed correctly' when the user enters a correct guess 
# 
# dice_roll.rb prints 'Shame on you' when the user enters an incorrect guess
