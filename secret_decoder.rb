# We have a program to encode our messages; now, can you write a program to decode them?
#
# Remember our secret code:
#   - a should be replaced with 1
#   - e should be replaced with 2
#   - i should be replaced with 3
#   - o should be replaced with 4
#   - u should be replaced with 5
#
# Your program should:
#
#   - Ask for an encoded message (the starter code already does this part).
#   - Decode the message.
#   - Display the decoded message.
#   - Be sure to capitalize the first word in the decoded message.


p "Enter in the secret you want to decode"
