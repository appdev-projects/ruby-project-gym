# Write a program that receives any amount of 
# numbers from a user separated by spaces. The 
# program should then print the sum of the odd numbers.
#
# For example, if the user were to enter “9 5 4” the 
# program should only sum the “9” and the “5”, because 
# those are odd numbers, and print a sum of 14.
#
# The excepted output would be similar to this below:
#
#   Enter at least 2 numbers separated by spaces: 
#   3 7 5 8 1 
#   16

p "Enter at least 2 numbers, separated by spaces:"


# ~~~~~ Specs (make it do these things) ~~~~~
#
# sum_odd_integers.rb prints "14" when the user enters '9 5 4' 
#
# sum_odd_integers.rb prints "0" when the user enters '2 4 6 8' 
#
# sum_odd_integers.rb prints "5" when the user enters '1 1 3'
