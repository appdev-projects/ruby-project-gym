# Write a program that:
#
#   - Asks the user for a secret message (the starter code already does this part).
#   - "Encodes" the message by replacing vowels with numbers.
#   - Here is our secret code, don’t tell anyone…
#
#       - a should be replaced with 1
#       - e should be replaced with 2
#       - i should be replaced with 3
#       - o should be replaced with 4
#       - u should be replaced with 5
#
# Your program should print the encoded message.

p "Enter in the secret you want to encode"


# ~~~~~ Specs (make it do these things) ~~~~~
#
# secret_encoder.rb should print '3 n22d t4 b2 m4r2 s2cr2t', when the input is 'I need to be more secret' 
# 
# secret_encoder.rb should print 'D4n't t2ll 1ny4n2 45r c4d2' when the input is 'Don't tell anyone our code'
